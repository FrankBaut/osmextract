# osmextractr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `osmextractr` is to make it easier for R
users to access freely available, community created geographic data, in
the form of OpenSteetMap data extracted by providers such as [Geofabrik
GmbH](http://download.geofabrik.de).

## Why osmextractr?

[`osmdata`](https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata) provides an R interface
to the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API),
which is ideal for downloading small OSM datasets. However, the API is
rate limited, making it hard to download large datasets. As a case
study, let’s try to download all cycleways in England:

```r
library(osmdata)
cycleways_england = opq("England") %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = "cycleway") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
# Error in check_for_error(doc) : General overpass server error; returned:
# The data included in this document is from www.openstreetmap.org. The data is made available under ODbL. runtime error: Query timed out in "query" at line 4 after 26 seconds. 
```

The query hanged with an error message after around 10 seconds. The same query can be made with `osmextractr` as follows, which reads-in almost 100k linestrings in less than 10 seconds (after the data has been downloaded in the compressed `.pbf` format and converted to the open standard `.gpkg` format, not evaluated):

```{r}
library(osmextractr)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
cycleways_england = osmext_get(
  "England",
  osmext_verbose = TRUE,
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway = 'cycleway'"
)
plot(sf::st_geometry(cycleways_england))
```

The package is designed to complement `osmdata` which has advantages
over `osmextractr` for small datasets: `osmdata` is likely to be quicker
for datasets less than ~10 MB, provides up-to-date data and has an
intuitive interface. `osmdata` can provide data in a range of formats,
while `osmextractr` only returns [`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)
objects. On the other hand, `osmextractr` provides a fast way to download
large OSM datasets in the highly compressed `pbf` format and read them
in via the fast C library
[GDAL](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html) and the R package
[`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of osmextractr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("osmextractr") -->

<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ITSLeeds/osmextractr")
```

## Usage

Give `osmextractr` the name of a geofabrik zone and it will download and
import it. By default it imports the ‘lines’ layer, but any layer can be
read-in. Behind the scenes, the function `read_pbf()`, a wrapper around
`sf::st_read()` is used with configuration options to import additional
columns from the `.pbf` files not imported by default, including
`maxspeed`, `lanes` and `oneway` (the attributes to include can be set
with `attributes` argument):


The leitmotif of package is to help the users to read and download extracts of OpenStreetMap data stored by several providers, such as [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/) or [bbbike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/). The provider's data are stored using `sf` objects that summarize the most important characteristics of each geographic zone, such as the name and the url of the pbf file.  

```{r}
library(sf)
osmextractr::geofabrik_zones[, c(2, 8)]
```

## Load package 

```{r}
library(osmextractr)
```

The packages is composed by 4 main functions: 

1. `osmext_match`: Match the input zone with one of the files stored by the OSM providers
2. `osmext_download`: Download the chosen file
3. `osmext_vectortranslate`: Convert the pbf format into gpkg
4. `osmext_read`: Read the gpkg file

The function `osmext_get` is a wrapper around all of them. 

# Test `osmext_match`

The simplest example: 

```{r}
osmext_match("Italy")
osmext_match("Isle of wight")
```

There are several situations where it could be difficult to find the appropriate data source due to several small differences in the official names: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
osmext_match("Korea")
osmext_match("Russia")
```

For these reasons we implemented the possibility to look for the appropriate area according to the [iso3166-1 alpha2](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code: 

```{r}
osmext_match("KP", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
osmext_match("RU", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
osmext_match("US", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

The are a few cases where the `iso3166-1 alpha2` codes can fail because there are no per-country extracts (e.g. Israel and Palestine)

```{r, error = TRUE}
osmext_match("PS", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
osmext_match("IL", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

For this reason we also created a function that let you explore the matching variables according to a chosen pattern, for example: 

```{r}
osmext_check_pattern("London")
osmext_check_pattern("Russia")
osmext_check_pattern("Korea")
osmext_check_pattern("Yorkshire")
osmext_check_pattern("US")
osmext_check_pattern("US", match_by = "iso3166_2")
osmext_check_pattern("Palestine")
osmext_check_pattern("Israel", full_row = TRUE)
```

The input `place` can be also specified using an `sfc_POINT` object with arbitrary CRS as documented in the following example. If there are multiple matches, the function returns the smallest area (according to the `level` variable). I would ignore the CRS warning for the moment. 

```{r}
coords_milan = sf::st_point(c(1514924.21, 5034552.92)) # Duomo di Milano
st_sfc_milan = sf::st_sfc(coords_milan, crs = 3003)
osmext_match(st_sfc_milan)
```

The input `place` can be also specified using a numeric vector of coordinates. In that case the CRS is assumed to be 4326:

```{r, error = TRUE}
osmext_match(c(9.1916, 45.4650)) # Duomo di Milano
osmext_match(c(9.1916, 45.4650, 9.2020, 45.4781))
# osmext_match(c(9.1916, 45.4650), c(9.2020, 45.4781)) FIXME with suitable check and error
```

If there are several error matching the input place with one of the zone, you can also try increasing the maximum allowed string distance: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
osmext_match("Isle Wight")
osmext_match("Isle Wight", max_string_dist = 3)
```

## Test `osmext_download`

The simplest example: 

```{r}
iow = osmext_match("Isle of Wight")
osmext_download(
  file_url = iow$url, 
  file_size = iow$file_size
)
```

If you want to download your data into a specific folder once, you can set the download directory: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv("OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY" = "/home/andrea/Downloads")
osmext_download(
  file_url = iow$url, 
  file_size = iow$file_size
)
#> /home/andrea/Downloads/geofabrik_isle-of-wight-latest.osm.pbf
```

If you want to set a directory that will persist, you can set `OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/for/osm/data` in your `.Renviron` file, e.g. with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
# Add a line containing: OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/to/save/files
```

## Importing OSM data

The function `osmext_get()` downloads (if not already downloaded) and reads-in data from OSM extract providers as an `sf` object:

```{r}
(iow = osmext_get("Isle of Wight", stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
class(iow)
names(iow) # default variable names
```

Once imported, we can use all the functions for data frames in base R and other packages.
We can also use functions from the `sf` package for spatial analysis and visualisation.
Let's plot all the major and minor roads, for example:

```{r}
iow_major_roads = iow[iow$highway %in% c("primary", "secondary"), ]
plot(iow_major_roads["highway"])
```

The same steps can be used to get other OSM datasets (note use of `osmext_verbose = TRUE` to show additional message, examples not run):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
test_malta = osmext_get("Malta", osmext_verbose = TRUE)
ncol(test_malta)
test_andorra = osmext_get("Andorra", extra_attributes = "ref", osmext_verbose = TRUE)
ncol(test_andorra)
```

## Queries

Some files from providers such as geofabrik are large.
You may therefore want to check the contents before importing them.
To do this you can use an SQL query that is passed to GDAL via `sf`.
To check the values stored in the highway column for our Isle of Wight example, for example, run the following command: 

```{r}
osmext_get(
  "Isle of Wight", 
  query = "SELECT DISTINCT highway FROM \"lines\" "
)
```

The values will vary.
There are more types of highway in the Andorra dataset, for example:

```{r}
osmext_get(
  "Andorra", 
  query = "SELECT DISTINCT highway FROM \"lines\" "
)
```

The same `query` argument can be used to read-in only certain features, all primary roads in Andorra for example: 

```{r}
# and select only one of them: 
iow_primary = osmext_get(
  "Isle of Wight", 
  extra_attributes = "ref", 
  osmext_verbose = TRUE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('primary')"
)
class(iow_primary)
plot(iow_primary$geometry)
```

This is substantially faster and less memory intensive than reading-in the whole dataset and filtering with R.

You can use [GDAL's SQL syntax](https://gdal.org/user/ogr_sql_dialect.html) to get the result you need.
Let's get all primary and secondary roads, for example:

```{r}
iow_major_roads2 = osmext_get(
  "Isle of Wight", 
  extra_attributes = "ref", 
  osmext_verbose = TRUE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('primary', 'secondary')"
)
plot(iow_major_roads2["highway"])
```

You can also use regex, as shown in the following command that gets roads that are likely to be walking and cycling friendly:

```{r}
iow_active_travel = osmext_get(
  "Isle of Wight", 
  extra_attributes = "ref", 
  osmext_verbose = TRUE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('cycleway', 'living_street')"
)
plot(iow_active_travel["highway"])
```

## Next steps

We hope to make the user interface to the SQL syntax more user friendly.
Any contributions to support this or any other improvements to the package are very welcome via our issue tracker.

## Licence

We hope this package will provide easy access to OSM data for reproducible research in the public interest, adhering to the condition of the [OdBL licence](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) which states that

> Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms of:
> - i. This License;
> - ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this
