# osmextract

<!-- badges: start -->

[![R build status](https://github.com/itsleeds/osmextract/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/itsleeds/osmextract/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `osmextract` is to make it easier for people access freely available, community created geographic data using free and open software that is conducive to reproducible and transparent research in the public interest.
`osmextract` downloads, converts and imports bulk OpenSteetMap data extracted by providers such as [Geofabrik
GmbH](http://download.geofabrik.de) and [bbbike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/).
For information on alternatives and how to add them see the [providers vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/osmextract/articles/providers.html).

## Why osmextract?

The package answers a common question for researchers who use OSM data:
how to get it into a statistical environment, in an appropriate format, as part of a computationally efficient and reproducible workflow?
Other packages answer parts of this question.
[`osmdata`](https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata), for example, is an R package that provides an R interface to the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API), which is ideal for downloading small OSM datasets.
However, the API is rate limited, making it hard to download large datasets.
As a case study, try to download all cycleways in England using `osmdata`:

```r
library(osmdata)
cycleways_england = opq("England") %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = "cycleway") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
# Error in check_for_error(doc) : General overpass server error; returned:
# The data included in this document is from www.openstreetmap.org. The data is made available under ODbL. runtime error: Query timed out in "query" at line 4 after 26 seconds. 
```

The query stops with an error message after around 10 seconds.
The same query can be made with `osmextract` as follows, which reads-in almost 100k linestrings in less than 10 seconds (after the data has been downloaded in the compressed `.pbf` format and converted to the open standard `.gpkg` format, not evaluated):

```{r}
library(osmextract)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
cycleways_england = oe_get(
  "England",
  quiet = FALSE,
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway = 'cycleway'"
)
plot(sf::st_geometry(cycleways_england))
```

The package is designed to complement `osmdata`, which has advantages over `osmextract` for small datasets: `osmdata` is likely to be quicker for datasets less than a few MB in size, provides up-to-date data and has an
intuitive interface. `osmdata` can provide data in a range of formats, while `osmextract` only returns [`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) objects.

`osmextract`'s niche is that it provides a fast way to download large OSM datasets in the highly compressed `pbf` format and read them in via the fast C library [GDAL](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html) and the popular R package for working with geographic data, [`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of osmextract from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("osmextract") -->

<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/osmextract")
```

Load the package with:

```{r}
library(osmextract)
```

To use alongside functionality in the `sf` package we also recommend attaching this geographic data package as follows:

```{r}
library(sf)
```


## Basic usage

Give `osmextract` a place name and it will try to 'find' it in a list of place names.
If the name you give it matches a place, it will download and import the associated data into R.
The function `oe_get()` downloads (if not already downloaded) and reads-in data from OSM extract providers as an `sf` object.
By default `oe_get()` imports the 'lines' layer, but any layer can be read-in by changing the `layer` argument:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# get bb of iow
tmaptools::geocode_OSM("isle of wight")
```


```{r points-lines-iow, fig.show='hold', out.width="50%"}
osm_lines = oe_get("Isle of Wight")
osm_points = oe_get("Isle of Wight", layer = "points")
nrow(osm_lines)
nrow(osm_points)
plot(osm_lines$geometry, xlim = c(-1.59, -1.1), ylim = c(50.5, 50.8))
plot(osm_points$geometry, xlim = c(-1.59, -1.1), ylim = c(50.5, 50.8))
```

The figures above give an insight into the volume and richness of data contained in OSM extracts.
Even for a small island such as the Isle of Wight, it contains over 100k features including ferry routes, shops and roads.
The column names in the `osm_lines` object are as follows:

```{r}
names(osm_lines) # default variable names
```

Once imported, you can use all the functions for data frames in base R and other packages.
We can also use functions from the `sf` package for spatial analysis and visualisation.
Let's plot all the major and minor roads, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
osm_lines$highway = as.character(osm_lines$highway)
```


```{r iow1}
osm_major_roads = osm_lines[osm_lines$highway %in% c("primary", "secondary"), ]
plot(osm_major_roads["highway"], key.pos = 1)
```

The same steps can be used to get other OSM datasets (note use of `quiet = FALSE` to show additional message, examples not run):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
test_malta = oe_get("Malta", quiet = FALSE)
test_andorra = oe_get("Andorra", extra_attributes = "ref", quiet = FALSE)
```

## Next steps

We hope to make the user interface to the SQL syntax more user friendly.
We would love to see more providers added (see the [Add new OpenStreetMap providers](https://itsleeds.github.io/osmextract/articles/providers.html) for details) and see what people can do with OSM datasets of the type provided by this package in a reproducible and open statistical programming environment for the greater good.
Any contributions to support this or any other improvements to the package are very welcome via our issue tracker.

## Licence

We hope this package will provide easy access to OSM data for reproducible research in the public interest, adhering to the condition of the [OdBL licence](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) which states that

> Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms of:

- i. This License;
- ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this

## Other approaches

<!-- todo: add links to other packages -->
- [osmdata](https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata) is an R package for importing small datasets directly from OSM servers
- [pyrosm](https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python package for reading .pbf files
- [OpenStreetMapX.jl](https://github.com/pszufe/OpenStreetMapX.jl) is a Julia package for reading and analysing .osm files
- [PostGIS](https://www.bostongis.com/PrinterFriendly.aspx?content_name=loading_osm_postgis) is an established spatial database that works well with large OSM datasets
- Any others? Let us know!
