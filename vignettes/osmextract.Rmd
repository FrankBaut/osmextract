This vignette provides an introduction to using the package, building on the README which covers installation and our motivations for creating it.

Loading the package generates important messages about the license associated with OSM data.

```{r setup}
library(osmextract)
```

The first thing to say is: do not ignore this message!
There are important legal considerations that you should be aware of before using OSM data, especially if you are working in a for-profit capacity.

# Legal considerations

Anyone using OSM data is bound by law to adhere to the [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) which means that you must:

- Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the ODbL. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database.
- Share-Alike: If you publicly use any adapted version of this database, or works produced from an adapted database, you must also offer that adapted database under the ODbL.
- Keep open: If you redistribute the database, or an adapted version of it, then you may use technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute a version without such measures.

In short, publicly using OSM data without attribution or selling datasets derived from it is illegal.
See the [License/Use Cases page on the OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/License/Use_Cases) for detailed use cases.

# Main package functions

The packages is composed of the following main functions: 

1. `oe_providers()`: Show which providers of OSM extracts are available;
1. `oe_match()`: Match the input zone with one of the files stored by the OSM providers;
1. `oe_download()`: Download the chosen file;
1. `oe_vectortranslate()`: Convert `.pbf` files into `.gpkg` files;
1. `oe_read()`: Read `.pbf` and `.gpkg` files;
1. `oe_get()`: Match, download, translate and import data in one step.

For many users who just want to get OSM data quickly `oe_get()` may be sufficient, as covered in the README.
We will demonstrate each function in turn.

## `oe_providers()`:list providers

`oe_providers()` lists the providers that are currently available with the version of `osmextract` you have installed.

```{r}
oe_providers()
```

You can read a detailed description of each provider data running, for example, `?geofabrik_zones` or `?bbbike_zones`. 
Each element in `database_name` is a data object that is packaged with `osmextract`.
Perhaps the best known bulk OSM data provider is Geofabrik, represented as data frame in the packaged object `geofabrik_zones`.

```{r}
class(geofabrik_zones)
```

Note that in addition to being a data frame with rows and columns, the object is also an `sf` object, as defined in the [package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) of the same name.
When working with `sf` objects it makes sense to have the package loaded:

```{r}
library(sf)
```

That gives you access to many geographic functions for working with geographic vector data of the type provided by `osmextract`.
Each row of data in an `sf` object contains a geometry, representing the area covered by each provider zone, meaning you can plot the data as follows:

```{r}
par(mar = rep(0.1, 4))
plot(st_geometry(geofabrik_zones))
```

The plot above shows how the provider divides geographic space into discrete chunks.
Different providers have other zoning systems.

```{r}
par(mar = rep(0.1, 4))
plot(st_geometry(bbbike_zones), xlim = c(-2, 10), ylim = c(30, 60))
```

As shown in the above visualisation of [BBBike.org](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/) zones in Europe, the provider offers rectangular extracts of major cities.
You can also download manually selected regions of interest from the BBBike website.

## `oe_match()`: finding OSM extracts

`oe_match()` takes one character string and returns one matching zone based on the minimum Approximate String Distance (`?adist`) between the input `place` and the `name` column in the provider data objects, such as `geofabrik_zones` (the default).
By default it returns a named list with the URL and file size (in bytes) of the corresponding `pbf` file hosted by the provider, as shown below.

```{r}
oe_match("Italy")
oe_match("Leeds", provider = "bbbike")
```

There are several situations where it could be difficult to find the appropriate data source:

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("Russia", quiet = FALSE)
```

We therefore enable search using alternative fields in the provider's data that can be specified using the `match_by` parameter. 
For example, working with `geofabrik_data`, we implemented the possibility of looking for a match with [iso3166-1 alpha2](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes: 

```{r}
oe_match("RU", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
oe_match("US", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

The are a few cases where the `iso3166-1 alpha2` codes in `geofabrik_data` do not work because there are no per-country extracts (e.g. Israel and Palestine):

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("PS", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
oe_match("IL", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

For this reason we also created a function that let you explore the matching variables according to a chosen pattern, for example:

```{r}
oe_match_pattern("London")
oe_match_pattern("Russia")
oe_match_pattern("Palestine")
oe_match_pattern("US", match_by = "iso3166_2")
oe_match_pattern("Washington", provider = "bbbike")
israel_sf = oe_match_pattern("Israel", full_row = TRUE)
```

This information can be used for selecting the appropriate match: 

```{r}
oe_match("Greater London")
```

The function returns an error if the minimum approximate string distance between the input `place` and the closest match is greater than the parameter `max_string_dist` (which defaults to 1). 
You can always increase this value, but be aware that it can be be dangerous: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("Isle Wight")
oe_match("Isle Wight", max_string_dist = 3)
oe_match("London", max_string_dist = 3, quiet = FALSE)
```

The parameter `max_string_dist` is set equal to 0 if `match_by` is equal to *iso3166_1_alpha2* or *iso3166_2* to avoid matching with the wrong iso3166 code. 

The function returns a warning message if there are multiple zones equidistant (according to approximate string distance) from the input `place`. 
In that case, it selects the first match: 

```{r, warning = TRUE}
oe_match("Belin")
```

### Finding zones based on geographic inputs

The input `place` can be also specified using an `sfc_POINT` object with arbitrary CRS as documented in the following example. 
The function will return a zone intersecting the `sfc_POINT` object (or an error, if the input point does not intersect any area). 
If the input `place` intersects multiple nested zones, the function returns the area with the highest `level`. 
Check the help page of `?geofabrik_zones` to understand the meaning of the `level` field.  
If there are multiple matches with the same level, then `oe_match()` function will return the area whose centroid is closest to the input `place`. 

```{r}
milan_duomo = sf::st_sfc(sf::st_point(c(1514924, 5034552)), crs = 3003)

# Check all geographical matches: 
all_matches_with_milan = geofabrik_zones[st_transform(milan_duomo, 4326), ]
oe_match(milan_duomo) # returns only the zone with highest level
```

The input `place` can be also specified using a numeric vector of coordinates. 
In that case the CRS is assumed to be 4326:

```{r}
oe_match(c(9.1916, 45.4650)) # Duomo di Milano using EPSG: 4326
```

To reduce unnecessary computational resources and save bandwidth/electricity, we will use a small OSM extract in subsequent sections that can be found as follows:

```{r}
its_details = oe_match("ITS Leeds", provider = "test")
its_details
```


## Download OSM data with `oe_download()`

The purpose of `oe_download()` is to download `.pbf` files representing OSM extracts for regions listed in the provider zones that can be found with functions such as `oe_match()` outlined in the previous section.
The function takes a URL as input and downloads the file in the directory specified by the parameter `download_directory`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
oe_download(
  file_url = its_details$url, 
  file_size = its_details$file_size,
  provider = "test",
  download_directory = "."
)
```

The argument `provider` can be omitted if the input `url` is associated with one of the regular OSM extract providers (such as Geofabrik or Bbbike). 
If you want to set a directory that will persist, you can set `OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/for/osm/data` in your `.Renviron` file, e.g. with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
# Add a line containing: OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/to/save/files
```

You can always check the default `download_directory` for `oe_download()` using: 

```{r}
oe_download_directory()
```


We strongly advise you set
## Convert OSM files with `oe_vectortranslate()`

## Read-in OSM datasets with `oe_read()`

## Do it all with `oe_get()`

To simplify the steps outlined above, while enabling modularity if needs be, we packaged them all into a single function that works as follows:

```{r}
its_lines = oe_get("ITS Leeds", provider = "test")
plot(its_lines)
```

# Queries

Some files from providers such as geofabrik are large.
You may therefore want to check the contents before importing them.
To do this you can use an SQL query that is passed to GDAL via `sf`.
To check the values stored in the highway column for our Isle of Wight example, for example, run the following command: 

```{r}
its_highway_values = oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds",
  provider = "test",
  query = "SELECT DISTINCT highway FROM \"lines\" "
)
nrow(its_highway_values)
its_highway_values$highway
```

The values will vary depending on how many types of highway are in the particular extract of interest.
There are more types of highway in the Andorra dataset, for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
andorra_highway_values = oe_get(
  "Andorra", 
  query = "SELECT DISTINCT highway FROM \"lines\" "
)
nrow(andorra_highway_values)
#> [1] 22
```

The same `query` argument can be used to read-in only certain features, all residential highway segments in the `its_lines` dataset for example: 

```{r, iow2}
# and select only one of them: 
its_residential = oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds",
  provider = "test",
  extra_tags = "ref", 
  quiet = FALSE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('residential')"
)
class(its_residential)
plot(its_residential$geometry)
```

This is substantially faster and less memory intensive than reading-in the whole dataset and filtering with R.
Computational efficiency is important when working with large OSM datasets provided by the package.

You can use [GDAL's SQL syntax](https://gdal.org/user/ogr_sql_dialect.html) to get the result you need.
Let's get all primary and secondary roads in the Isle of Wight, for example (result not shown):

```{r, iow3, eval=FALSE}
iow_major_roads2 = oe_get(
  "Isle of Wight", 
  extra_tags = "ref", 
  quiet = FALSE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('primary', 'secondary')"
)
# plot(iow_major_roads2["highway"])
```

You can also use regex, as shown in the following command that gets roads that are likely to be walking and cycling friendly:

```{r, iow4}
its_active_travel = oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds",
  provider = "test",
  extra_tags = "ref", 
  quiet = FALSE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('cycleway', 'pedestrian', 'footway')"
)
plot(its_active_travel["highway"], key.pos = 1)
```

# Other providers

At present `geofabrik` and `bbbike` providers are supported.
An example showing how to use an alternative provider is shown in the example below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
leeds = oe_get(place = "Leeds", provider = "bbbike", quiet = FALSE)
names(leeds)
#> [1] "osm_id"     "name"       "highway"    "waterway"   "aerialway"  "barrier"    "man_made"   "z_order"    "other_tags" "geometry"  
plot(leeds$geometry)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/87104595-46d8b180-c250-11ea-878f-8936c0a7bd30.png")
```


The package supports downloading, reading and extracting OpenStreetMap data from various providers.
A list of providers can be found at [wiki.openstreetmap.org](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Processed_data_providers).
The first provider supported was [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/).
The second was [bbbike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/).
The package can be extended to support additional providers, as seen in [code](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/osmextract/commit/be3b48e7ed7ccd957e988bacad053161247b206d) that adds a working test provider.

Providers break the world into zones and, as described in the 'List providers' section above, these zones are represented as `sf` objects that summarize the most important characteristics of each geographic zone, such as the name and the url of the pbf file, as illustrated in the code chunk below.

```{r}
names(geofabrik_zones)
st_drop_geometry(geofabrik_zones[1:3, c(2, 8)])
bbbike_zones$name[1:20]
```


<!-- Behind the scenes, the function `oe_read()` is used to translate and read-in `.pbf` files using `sf::st_read()`. -->
<!-- Various configuration options can be used to import additional columns from the `.pbf` files not imported by default, including `maxspeed`, `lanes` and `oneway` (the attributes to include can be set -->
<!-- with `attributes` argument). -->
For information on adding new providers to the package, see the [providers vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/osmextract/articles/providers.html).

# More on OpenStreetMap

There is a world of knowledge, convention and wisdom contained in OSM data that we hope this package helps you discover and use this knowledge for public benefit.
To learn more about the structure of OSM data and the various tagging systems and conventions, the [Elements page on the OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements) is an ideal place to start.
You will find much more excellent content on the OSM wiki pages.

# Contributing to OSM

The final thing to say in this introductory vignette is that as a citizen-led project like Wikipedia, OSM relies on a participatory culture, where people not only consume but contribute data, to survive.
On that note we urge anyone reading this to at least sign-up to get an OSM account at [osm.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

We highly recommend contributing to the world's geographic commons.
The step from being a user to being a contributor of OSM data is a small one and can be highly rewarding.
If you find any issues with OSM data, people in the OpenStreetMap will be very happy for you to correct the data.
Once logged-in, you can contribute by using editors such as the excellent ID editor, which you can get to by zooming into anywhere you want at [www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and clicking "Edit".
