This vignette provides an introduction to using the package, building on the README which covers installation and our motivations for creating it.

Loading the package generates important messages about the license associated with OSM data.

```{r setup}
library(osmextract)
```

The first thing to say is: do not ignore this message!
There are important legal considerations that you should be aware of before using OSM data, especially if you are working in a for-profit capacity.

# Legal considerations

Anyone using OSM data is bound by law to adhere to the [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) which means that you must:

- Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the ODbL. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database.
- Share-Alike: If you publicly use any adapted version of this database, or works produced from an adapted database, you must also offer that adapted database under the ODbL.
- Keep open: If you redistribute the database, or an adapted version of it, then you may use technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute a version without such measures.

In short, publicly using OSM data without attribution or selling datasets derived from it is illegal.
See the [License/Use Cases page on the OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/License/Use_Cases) for detailed use cases.

# Main package functions

The packages is composed of the following main functions: 

1. `oe_providers()`: Show which providers of OSM extracts are available;
1. `oe_match()`: Match the input zone with one of the files stored by the OSM providers;
1. `oe_download()`: Download the chosen file;
1. `oe_vectortranslate()`: Convert `.pbf` files into `.gpkg` files;
1. `oe_read()`: Read `.pbf` and `.gpkg` files;
1. `oe_get()`: Match, download, translate and import data in one step.

For many users who just want to get OSM data quickly `oe_get()` may be sufficient, as covered in the README.
We will demonstrate each function in turn.

## `oe_providers()`:list providers

`oe_providers()` lists the providers that are currently available with the version of `osmextract` you have installed.

```{r}
oe_providers()
```

You can read a detailed description of each provider data running, for example, `?geofabrik_zones` or `?bbbike_zones`. 
Each element in `database_name` is a data object that is packaged with `osmextract`.
Perhaps the best known bulk OSM data provider is Geofabrik, represented as data frame in the packaged object `geofabrik_zones`.

```{r}
class(geofabrik_zones)
```

Note that in addition to being a data frame with rows and columns, the object is also an `sf` object, as defined in the [package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) of the same name.
When working with `sf` objects it makes sense to have the package loaded:

```{r}
library(sf)
```

That gives you access to many geographic functions for working with geographic vector data of the type provided by `osmextract`.
Each row of data in an `sf` object contains a geometry, representing the area covered by each provider zone, meaning you can plot the data as follows:

```{r}
par(mar = rep(0.1, 4))
plot(st_geometry(geofabrik_zones))
```

The plot above shows how the provider divides geographic space into discrete chunks.
Different providers have other zoning systems.

```{r}
par(mar = rep(0.1, 4))
plot(st_geometry(bbbike_zones), xlim = c(-2, 10), ylim = c(30, 60))
```

As shown in the above visualisation of [BBBike.org](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/) zones in Europe, the provider offers rectangular extracts of major cities.
You can also download manually selected regions of interest from the BBBike website.

## `oe_match()`: finding OSM extracts

`oe_match()` takes one character string and returns one matching zone based on the minimum Approximate String Distance (`?adist`) between the input `place` and the `name` column in the provider data objects, such as `geofabrik_zones` (the default).
By default it returns a named list with the URL and file size (in bytes) of the corresponding `pbf` file hosted by the provider, as shown below.

```{r}
oe_match("Italy")
oe_match("Leeds", provider = "bbbike")
```

There are several situations where it could be difficult to find the appropriate data source:

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("Russia", quiet = FALSE)
```

We therefore enable search using alternative fields in the provider's data that can be specified using the `match_by` parameter. 
For example, working with `geofabrik_data`, we implemented the possibility of looking for a match with [iso3166-1 alpha2](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes: 

```{r}
oe_match("RU", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
oe_match("US", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

The are a few cases where the `iso3166-1 alpha2` codes in `geofabrik_data` do not work because there are no per-country extracts (e.g. Israel and Palestine):

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("PS", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
oe_match("IL", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

For this reason we also created a function that let you explore the matching variables according to a chosen pattern, for example:

```{r}
oe_match_pattern("London")
oe_match_pattern("Russia")
oe_match_pattern("Palestine")
oe_match_pattern("US", match_by = "iso3166_2")
oe_match_pattern("Washington", provider = "bbbike")
israel_sf = oe_match_pattern("Israel", full_row = TRUE)
```

This information can be used for selecting the appropriate match: 

```{r}
oe_match("Greater London")
```

The function returns an error if the minimum approximate string distance between the input `place` and the closest match is greater than the parameter `max_string_dist` (which defaults to 1). 
You can always increase this value, but be aware that it can be be dangerous: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("Isle Wight")
oe_match("Isle Wight", max_string_dist = 3)
oe_match("London", max_string_dist = 3, quiet = FALSE)
```

The parameter `max_string_dist` is set equal to 0 if `match_by` is equal to *iso3166_1_alpha2* or *iso3166_2* to avoid matching with the wrong iso3166 code. 

The function returns a warning message if there are multiple zones equidistant (according to approximate string distance) from the input `place`. 
In that case, it selects the first match: 

```{r, warning = TRUE}
oe_match("Belin")
```

### Finding zones based on geographic inputs

The input `place` can be also specified using an `sfc_POINT` object with arbitrary CRS as documented in the following example. 
The function will return a zone intersecting the `sfc_POINT` object (or an error, if the input point does not intersect any area). 
If the input `place` intersects multiple nested zones, the function returns the area with the highest `level`. 
Check the help page of `?geofabrik_zones` to understand the meaning of the `level` field.  
If there are multiple matches with the same level, then `oe_match()` function will return the area whose centroid is closest to the input `place`. 

```{r}
milan_duomo = sf::st_sfc(sf::st_point(c(1514924, 5034552)), crs = 3003)

# Check all geographical matches: 
oe_match(milan_duomo) # returns only the zone with highest level
```

The input `place` can be also specified using a numeric vector of coordinates. 
In that case the CRS is assumed to be 4326:

```{r}
oe_match(c(9.1916, 45.4650)) # Duomo di Milano using EPSG: 4326
```

To reduce unnecessary computational resources and save bandwidth/electricity, we will use a small OSM extract in subsequent sections that can be found as follows:

```{r}
its_details = oe_match("ITS Leeds", provider = "test")
its_details
```

## `oe_download()`: download OSM data 

The purpose of `oe_download()` is to download `.pbf` files representing OSM extracts for regions listed in the provider zones that can be found with functions such as `oe_match()` outlined in the previous section.
The function takes a URL as input and downloads the file in the directory specified by the parameter `download_directory`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
oe_download(
  file_url = its_details$url, 
  file_size = its_details$file_size,
  provider = "test",
  download_directory = "."
)
```

The argument `provider` can be omitted if the input `url` is associated with one of the regular providers (such as Geofabrik or Bbbike).
The default value for `download_directory` is `tempdir()`, but, if you want to set a directory that will persist, you can set `OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/for/osm/data` in your `.Renviron` file, e.g. with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
# Add a line containing: OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/to/save/files
```

You can always check the default `download_directory` used by `oe_download()` with: 

```{r}
oe_download_directory()
```

We strongly advise you setting a persistent directory since downloading and converting (see the next sub-section) `.pbf` file are expensive operations, that are skipped by `oe_*()` function if they detect that the input `.pbf` file was already downloaded. 

More precisely, `oe_download()` runs several checks before actually downloading a new file, to avoid overloading the OSM providers. 
The first step when running the function is the definition of the file's path associated with the input `file_url` where the `.pbf` file will be saved. 
The path is created by pasting together the `download_directory`, the name of chosen provider, `provider`, which may be inferred from the input url, and the `basename()` of the url. 
For example, if `file_url = "https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/italy-latest.osm.pbf"`, and `download_directory = "/tmp/`, then the path is built as `/tmp/geofabrik_italy-latest.osm.pbf`. 
Then, the function checks if there exists a file with the same path and, in that case, it returns the path without downloading anything. 
The parameter `force_download` is used to modify this behaviour.
If there is no file associated with the file's path, then the function downloads a new file using `download.file()` with `destfile` equal to the new path and `mode = "wb"`, and, again, it returns the path. 

## `oe_vectortranslate()`: convert to gpkg format

`oe_vectortranslate()` function was defined to translate a `.osm.pbf` file into `.gpkg` format. 
The new `.gpkg` file is created in the same directory as the input `.pbf` file.
The conversion is performed using [ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html#ogr2ogr) through `vectortranslate` utility in [sf::gdal_utils()] . 
It was created following [the suggestions](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/2100#issuecomment-565707053) of the maintainers of GDAL.

Let's start with an example.
First we download the `.pbf` file associated to the ITS test file: 

```{r}
its_pbf = oe_download(its_details$url, provider = "test")
```

and then we convert it to `.gpkg` format: 

```{r}
its_gpkg = oe_vectortranslate(its_pbf)
list.files(oe_download_directory())
```

The translation process is performed using the `vectortranslate` utility in `sf::gdal_utils()`. 
This operation can be customized in several ways modifying the parameters `layer`, `extra_tags`, `osmconf_ini`, and `vectortranslate_options`.

### `layer`

The `.pbf` files processed using GDAL are usually categorized into 5 layers, named `points`, `lines`, `multilinestrings`, `multipolygons` and `other_relations`. 
Check the first paragraphs [here](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html) for more details.
The `oe_vectortranslate()` function can covert only one later at a time, and the parameter `layer` is used to specify which layer of the `.pbf` file should be converted into `.gpkg` file. 
Several layers with different names can be stored in the same `.gpkg` file.
By default, the function will convert the `lines` layer (which is the most common one according to our experience).

So, for example, 

```{r}
st_layers(its_pbf, do_count = TRUE)
```

while

```{r}
st_layers(its_gpkg, do_count = TRUE)
```

but we can add another layer: 

```{r}
its_gpkg = oe_vectortranslate(its_pbf, layer = "points")
st_layers(its_gpkg, do_count = TRUE)
```

### `osmconf_ini` and `extra_tags`

The arguments `osmconf_ini` and `extra_tags` are used to modify how GDAL reads and processes a `.pbf` file. 
More precisely, several operations that GDAL performs on the input `.pbf` file are governed by a `CONFIG` file, that you can check at the following [link](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/data/osmconf.ini). 
The basic components of OSM data are called [*elements*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements) and they are divided into *nodes*, *ways* or *relations*. 
So, for example, the code at line 7 of the CONFIG file is used to determine which *ways* are assumed to be polygons (according to the simple-feature definition of polygon) if they are closed.
The parameter `osmconf_ini` is used to pass your own `CONFIG` file in case you need great control over the GDAL operations. 
If `osmconf_ini` is equal to `NULL` (the default), then the function uses default `osmconf.ini` file defined by GDAL (but for the extra tags, see below).
OSM data is usually described using several [*tags*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags), i.e a pair of two items: a *key* and a *value*.
The code at lines 33, 53, 85, 103, and 121 is used to determine, for each layer, which tags should be explicitly reported as fields (while all the other tags are stored in the `other_tags` column). 
The parameter `extra_tags` is used to determine which extra tags (i.e. key/value pairs) should be added to the `.gpkg` file.

The `oe_get_keys()` function can be used to check all the `keys` that are stored in the `other_tags` field for a given `.gpkg` file: 

```{r}
oe_get_keys(its_gpkg, layer = "lines")
```

Now we can also re-create the `.gpkg` file adding new `tags` (i.e. key/value pairs): 

```{r}
its_gpkg = oe_vectortranslate(its_pbf, extra_tags = c("oneway", "maxspeed"))
```

We will present more complex use-cases in the `oe_get()` section. 

### `vectortranslate_options`

The parameter `vectortranslate_options` is used to control the arguments that are passed to `ogr2ogr` via `sf::gdal_utils()` when converting between `.pbf` and `.gpkg` formats. 
`ogr2ogr` can perform various operations during the conversion process, such as spatial filters or SQL queries. 
These operations are determined by the `vectortranslate_options` argument. 
If `NULL` (default value), then `vectortranslate_options` is set equal to `c("-f", "GPKG", "-overwrite", "-oo", paste0("CONFIG_FILE=", osmconf_ini),  "-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry", layer)`. Explanation:

* `"-f", "GPKG"` says that the output format is `GPKG`;
* `"-overwrite` is used to delete an existing layer and recreate it empty;
* `"-oo", paste0("CONFIG_FILE=", osmconf_ini)` is used to set the [Open Options](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html#open-options) for the `.osm.pbf` file and change the `CONFIG` file (in case the user  asks for any extra tag or a totally different CONFIG file);
* `"-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry"` is used to change the [layer creation options](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/gpkg.html?highlight=gpkg#layer-creation-options) for the `.gpkg` file and modify the name of the geometry column; 
* `layer` indicates which layer should be converted.

Check the following sections to see a few examples with different vectortranslate options. 

### Other notes

By default, the vectortranslate operations are skipped if the function detects a file having the same path as the input file, `.gpkg` extension and a layer with the same name as the parameter `layer` with all `extra_tags`. 
In that case the function will simply return the path of the `.gpkg` file. 
This behaviour can be overwritten by setting `force_vectortranslate = TRUE`. 
If `osmconf_ini` parameter is not NULL, the vectortranslate operations are never skipped.

## `oe_read()`: read-in OSM data 

The `oe_read()` function is wrapper around `oe_download()`, `oe_vector()`, and `sf::st_read()`. 
It is used for reading-in a `.pbf` or `.gpkg` file that is specified using its path or its url. 

So, for example, the following code can be used for reading-in the `its-gpkg` file: 

```{r}
oe_read(its_pbf, quiet = FALSE)
```

The vectortranslate operations can be skipped with the parameter `skip_vectortranslate`: 

```{r}
oe_read(its_pbf, skip_vectortranslate = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
```

We can see that the second example includes 9 fields (the default tags) while the first example includes 11 fields (the default tags + `oneway` and `maxspeed`, that were added a few chunks above). 

## `oe_get()`: Do it all in one step 

To simplify the steps outlined above, while enabling modularity if needs be, we packaged them all into a single function that works as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
its_lines = oe_get("ITS Leeds", provider = "test")
plot(its_lines["osm_id"], lwd = 2)
```

The function `oe_get` is a wrapper around `oe_match()` and `oe_read()` and it summarizes the algorithm that we use for importing OSM extracts: 

1. Match the input `place` with the url of a `.pbf` file through `oe_match()`;
2. Download the corresponding `.pbf` file using `oe_download()`; 
3) Convert it into `.gpkg` format using `oe_vectortranslate()`; 
4) Read-in the `.gpkg` file using `sf::st_read()`. 

The following expressiong (not evaluated) can be used to get the OSM extracts associated with the input `place`, after downloading the `.pbf` file and performing the vectortranslate operations: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
oe_get("Andorra", quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("Leeds", provider = "bbbike", quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("Malta", layer = "points", quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("RU",match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2", quiet = FALSE)

oe_get("Andorra", download_only = TRUE)
oe_get_keys(oe_get("Andorra", download_only = TRUE))
oe_get("Andorra", extra_tags = c("maxspeed", "oneway", "ref", "junction"), quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("Andora", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, quiet = TRUE, as_tibble = TRUE) # like read_sf
```

The arguments `osmconf_ini`, `vectortranslate_options` and `query` (in `sf::st_read`) can be used to further optimize the process.  

### osmconf_ini 

### vectortranslate_options

### query

### Queries

Some files from providers such as geofabrik are large.
You may therefore want to check the contents before importing them.
To do this you can use an SQL query that is passed to GDAL via `sf`.
To check the values stored in the highway column for our Isle of Wight example, for example, run the following command: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
its_highway_values = oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds",
  provider = "test",
  query = "SELECT DISTINCT highway FROM \"lines\" "
)
nrow(its_highway_values)
its_highway_values$highway
```

The values will vary depending on how many types of highway are in the particular extract of interest.
There are more types of highway in the Andorra dataset, for example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
andorra_highway_values = oe_get(
  "Andorra", 
  query = "SELECT DISTINCT highway FROM \"lines\" "
)
nrow(andorra_highway_values)
#> [1] 22
```

The same `query` argument can be used to read-in only certain features, all residential highway segments in the `its_lines` dataset for example: 

```{r, iow2, eval = FALSE}
# and select only one of them: 
its_residential = oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds",
  provider = "test",
  extra_tags = "ref", 
  quiet = FALSE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('residential')"
)
class(its_residential)
plot(its_residential$geometry)
```

This is substantially faster and less memory intensive than reading-in the whole dataset and filtering with R.
Computational efficiency is important when working with large OSM datasets provided by the package.

You can use [GDAL's SQL syntax](https://gdal.org/user/ogr_sql_dialect.html) to get the result you need.
Let's get all primary and secondary roads in the Isle of Wight, for example (result not shown):

```{r, iow3, eval=FALSE}
iow_major_roads2 = oe_get(
  "Isle of Wight", 
  extra_tags = "ref", 
  quiet = FALSE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('primary', 'secondary')"
)
# plot(iow_major_roads2["highway"])
```

You can also use regex, as shown in the following command that gets roads that are likely to be walking and cycling friendly:

```{r, iow4}
its_active_travel = oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds",
  provider = "test",
  extra_tags = "ref", 
  quiet = FALSE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('cycleway', 'pedestrian', 'footway')"
)
plot(its_active_travel["highway"], key.pos = 1)
```

# Other providers

At present `geofabrik` and `bbbike` providers are supported.
An example showing how to use an alternative provider is shown in the example below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
leeds = oe_get(place = "Leeds", provider = "bbbike", quiet = FALSE)
names(leeds)
#> [1] "osm_id"     "name"       "highway"    "waterway"   "aerialway"  "barrier"    "man_made"   "z_order"    "other_tags" "geometry"  
plot(leeds$geometry)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/87104595-46d8b180-c250-11ea-878f-8936c0a7bd30.png")
```


The package supports downloading, reading and extracting OpenStreetMap data from various providers.
A list of providers can be found at [wiki.openstreetmap.org](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Processed_data_providers).
The first provider supported was [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/).
The second was [bbbike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/).
The package can be extended to support additional providers, as seen in [code](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/osmextract/commit/be3b48e7ed7ccd957e988bacad053161247b206d) that adds a working test provider.

Providers break the world into zones and, as described in the 'List providers' section above, these zones are represented as `sf` objects that summarize the most important characteristics of each geographic zone, such as the name and the url of the pbf file, as illustrated in the code chunk below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(geofabrik_zones)
st_drop_geometry(geofabrik_zones[1:3, c(2, 8)])
bbbike_zones$name[1:20]
```


<!-- Behind the scenes, the function `oe_read()` is used to translate and read-in `.pbf` files using `sf::st_read()`. -->
<!-- Various configuration options can be used to import additional columns from the `.pbf` files not imported by default, including `maxspeed`, `lanes` and `oneway` (the attributes to include can be set -->
<!-- with `attributes` argument). -->
For information on adding new providers to the package, see the [providers vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/osmextract/articles/providers.html).

# More on OpenStreetMap

There is a world of knowledge, convention and wisdom contained in OSM data that we hope this package helps you discover and use this knowledge for public benefit.
To learn more about the structure of OSM data and the various tagging systems and conventions, the [Elements page on the OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements) is an ideal place to start.
You will find much more excellent content on the OSM wiki pages.

# Contributing to OSM

The final thing to say in this introductory vignette is that as a citizen-led project like Wikipedia, OSM relies on a participatory culture, where people not only consume but contribute data, to survive.
On that note we urge anyone reading this to at least sign-up to get an OSM account at [osm.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

We highly recommend contributing to the world's geographic commons.
The step from being a user to being a contributor of OSM data is a small one and can be highly rewarding.
If you find any issues with OSM data, people in the OpenStreetMap will be very happy for you to correct the data.
Once logged-in, you can contribute by using editors such as the excellent ID editor, which you can get to by zooming into anywhere you want at [www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and clicking "Edit".
